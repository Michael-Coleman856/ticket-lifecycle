<h1>osTicket - LifeCycle Examples Setup</h1>
</p>
This tutorial demonstrates the creation of tickets as an end user .<br />

</p>
</p>

<p>
Karen is creating a ticket, the help topic is "Business Critical Outage" because customers are reporting that they cannot access mobile banking.

Agents will be able to see live tickets in the agent panel. Queue managers will assign priority tickets to the appropriate agents as well as assigning proper SLAs.

<p>
In this example we are setting the priority level of the ticket. The priority has been set to Emergency since we are dealing with an issue that can effect an entire portion of the business. We have changed the SLA plan and assigned the ticket to a top level technician. In some ticketing system customers can set their own SLA plans.
